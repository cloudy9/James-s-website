        <p>as my school life has been one of the best experiences in my life, my school career really picked up when my gcse's began becasue of the freedom of the lessons and as i chose business studies, CIDA and Computer Science these options really helped expand my options in life as my work experience is work at a software solutions company computer science is the main lesson that helps me with that.
