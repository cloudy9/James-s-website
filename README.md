# James's-website
This website is about me with 4 pages: About, Home, Contact and Achievements. these 4 pages arent your standard 4 pages with writing and 
images on them, these pages have little things that give the website a bit of life. for example on the file "ContactCSS" there is a queries 
form which sends your queries straight to an email I set up to track the queries.

you will need to use the javascript file for all of the pages to make the top nav bar respond.

the source code for the following addon can be found at this place:

the quiz on the "About page" can be found on, http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/webmaster/projects/making-your-website-fun-with-games.html.
